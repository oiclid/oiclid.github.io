About Me
--------

I am a Software Developer with extensive experience in developing
Python, JavaScript, and WordPress applications; providing Technical
Support; and managing teams. I have developed application using Django,
Flask, and Node, as well as with various libraries including d3.js,
React, Pandas, SciKits, and Matplotlib.

I have over 15 years experience working for startups, studios, and
consultancies including 42Labs, [PM Global
Technology](https://www.pmglobaltechnology.com/), [Center for Health and

Systems](cetracom.net). I have also worked on projects for
